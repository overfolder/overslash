# Overslash — TODO

Phased roadmap. Each phase is usable independently.

---

## Spec–Code Misalignments

All resolved via PRs #29–#40 — see Done section for detail.

### Dashboard (dashboard/ vs UI_SPEC.md)

Existing dashboard code predates the unified permission model and template/service split.

**High priority:**
- [ ] Types: remove Mode A/B/C execution variants, unify into single `ExecuteRequest` with service + action
- [x] Types: `risk` is now a `Risk` enum (`read|write|delete`) — aligned with spec
- [ ] Types: add template/service instance split (`ServiceTemplate` + `ServiceInstance`)
- [ ] Types: add permission key types (`{service}:{action}:{arg}`)
- [ ] Types: remove `approval_url` from `ExecuteResponse` (no self-auth approval URLs)
- [ ] Login: extract from profile page to standalone `/login` page with logo, multi-IdP buttons (uses `GET /auth/providers`), redirect-back-after-auth
- [ ] IdP config: **edit** UI for existing configs — create/delete/toggle shipped; dashboard lacks a form to update client_id/secret or flip `use_org_credentials` (backend `PUT /v1/org-idp-configs/{id}` already supports it — see TECH_DEBT.md §3)
- [ ] Stores: remove `executionMode` (A/B/C), `connections` store; update to unified model

**Medium priority:**
- [ ] Layout: add nav items (Agents, Services, Secrets, Audit Log; ADMIN: Users, Groups)
- [ ] Layout: collapsible sidebar (labels+icons expanded, icons-only collapsed)
- [ ] Layout: notification bell in top bar with badge count
- [ ] Layout: profile avatar at bottom of sidebar (not a nav item)
- [ ] Logo: change from `//` to `Overs/ash` per spec
- [ ] API client: split `GET /v1/services` into templates + instances endpoints
- [ ] API client: remove `GET /v1/connections` (connections absorbed into services)

**Low priority:**
- [ ] Profile: expand with API keys, secrets, remembered approvals, settings sections
- [ ] CSS: add light mode + theme toggle (currently dark-only)

### Review Corrections (2026-04-10)

- [ ] Rename: "Dashboard" nav item and view to "Agents" — make it the default landing view
- [ ] Rename: all UI references from "Identities" to "Agents"
- [ ] Agents view: User node is tree root, immutable (no delete/rename/move). No adding User identities.
- [ ] Create agent: remove Kind dropdown. Only agent creation allowed; parent determines hierarchy position.
- [ ] Dark mode: increase contrast for accent hover states and badge/pill backgrounds (e.g., "inherit" pill). Target WCAG AA (4.5:1) for all badge text in dark mode.
- [ ] Delete confirmation: replace all `window.confirm()` / browser-native dialogs with styled modal component per UI_SPEC.
- [ ] Org Settings: fix "Cannot load org settings. Admin access required" for Dev Users. Dev Login users must have org-admin access in development mode.
- [x] Docker: cache Rust toolchain layer in dev Dockerfile to avoid re-downloading rustup components on every `make dev` run. (PRs #97, #98)
- [ ] (Backlog) Template Editor: build and make accessible from Services view
- [ ] (Backlog) API Explorer: ensure accessible and functional for testing the overslash meta-service

### Review Corrections (2026-04-20)

Consolidated backlog cards from [docs/review/2026-04-20.md](docs/review/2026-04-20.md). Each card groups related review items and has a corresponding entry on the Kanban board.

- [ ] **Approval System UX Overhaul** (card `20ae2`) — canonical `OVERSLASH_DASHBOARD_URL` envvar threaded through approval URLs (currently points at `overslash.example`), inline "Allow Once" on /agents, modal/dropdown resolver with expiry and granularity pickers, hide "Bubble Up" when the current user is already the resolver
- [ ] **Missing Dashboard Views: Audit Log + API Explorer + Notification Dropdown** (card `504a7`) — Audit Log view, API Explorer accessibility from main nav, Notification bell dropdown of notifications
- [ ] **Services View & Data Display Fixes** (card `73d90`) — show username/email not UUID for service owners, fix `/users/{name}` 404, correct the `overslash` meta-service "Needs Setup" copy, group pills as a column on service list, add `category` field to all templates, services connectable to groups from the detail view
- [ ] **OAuth Connections & Provider UX Fixes** (card `c2575`) — stop creating phantom Identity Provider + UUID connection when admin adds a Google OAuth Client ID, reuse connections across services sharing the same provider, show provider email / identity instead of UUIDs, support incremental scopes auth
- [ ] **MCP Login Flow Fixes** (card `877cb`) — assignment/consent page served from dashboard (not api), default `inherit_permissions = true` for new MCP agents, reuse the existing agent on reauthentication, hide revoked MCP clients from the UI after 3s
- [~] **UI Component Polish: Toggle Switches + Date Formatting** (card `2e268`, in progress) — design-system Toggle Switch component adopted everywhere (starting with "Inherits Permissions"), fix "Requested Invalid Date" rendering on Pending Approvals
- [ ] Multi-org login design for Cloud Overslash (deferred — future design work)

---

## Phase 1: Core Service (MVP) ✅

- [x] Project scaffold (Rust/Axum, Cargo workspace, Docker)
- [x] PostgreSQL schema + migrations (sqlx)
- [x] Orgs CRUD
- [x] Identities CRUD (users + agents, flat — no hierarchy yet)
- [x] API key issuance + authentication middleware
- [x] Secret vault with versioning (PUT, GET metadata, restore, soft-delete)
- [x] `POST /v1/actions/execute` — raw HTTP with secret injection (`http` pseudo-service)
- [x] Permission rules (flat per-identity, no chain yet)
- [x] Approval workflow — create, resolve (allow/deny/allow_remember), expire
- [x] Secret request page (standalone signed-URL web page — safe because providing a secret doesn't grant agent authority). Follow-ups: backend `deny` endpoint + audit event; wire `overslash_auth.request_secret` and `create_service_from_template` to mint requests.
- [x] Audit trail (log every action, approval, secret access)
- [x] Agents view: minimal — superseded by Phase 2.5 Agents redesign per Figma (PR #105)
- [x] Webhook delivery (approval.created, approval.resolved)

## Phase 2: OAuth + Service Registry (in progress)

- [x] OAuth engine (authorization URL, code exchange, token storage, auto-refresh)
- [x] BYOC credential support (identity, org, system fallback chain)
- [x] Connections API (initiate, list, revoke) — to be refactored into service instances
- [x] `on_behalf_of` for agent-initiated service creation at user level (PR #90)
- [x] Global service template registry — OpenAPI 3.1 loader for shipped definitions
- [ ] Ship top 20 service templates — 9 shipped: Eventbrite, GitHub, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Resend, Slack, Stripe, X (plus the `overslash` platform namespace)
- [x] Template/service split — templates (OpenAPI blueprints) + services (named instances with credentials) (PR #31)
- [x] Three-tier template registry — global (OpenAPI, read-only) + org (DB, CRUD) + user (DB, CRUD, gated by org setting) (PR #100)
- [x] Service instances — create from template, bind credentials, assign to groups (PR #31)
- [x] Template validation endpoint (`POST /v1/templates/validate`) — OpenAPI 3.1 parse + alias normalization + struct-level lint in `overslash-core::template_validation`. WASM feature gate in place for client-side reuse.
- [x] OpenAPI-native template format — OpenAPI 3.1 with `x-overslash-*` vendor extensions (risk, scope_param, resolve, provider, default_secret_name, category, key, platform_actions) and unprefixed aliases that canonicalize on save.
- [ ] Bulk OpenAPI import UX — upload/paste a vendor's public spec and auto-generate a template with sensible `x-overslash-*` overlay defaults.
- [ ] User-to-org template sharing (propose, approve/deny)
- [x] Service + action execution (registry-resolved, auth auto-resolve)
- [x] Human-readable action descriptions from registry metadata (description interpolation, PR #35)

## Phase 2.5: Dashboard

### Dashboard (SvelteKit + TypeScript)

- [x] Scaffold SvelteKit project with TypeScript, auth, API client, and user profile view
- [ ] Agents view (default landing) — tree visualization with inline identity management
- [ ] Services view — template catalog, service instances, create/manage/connect
- [x] Developer connection tool — interactive API explorer (execute via Mode A/B/C, like Swagger UI for Overslash)
- [ ] Audit log view — searchable, filterable log with identity/service/time/event filters

### Agent Enrollment

- [x] MCP OAuth 2.1 enrollment — `/oauth/authorize`, `/oauth/consent`, DCR, PKCE, `overslash mcp login` CLI (PRs #121, #123, #142)
- [x] `SKILL.md` at repo root, served at `/SKILL.md` — v1 enrollment instructions for agents

## Phase 3: Identity Hierarchy + Permissions

- [x] Parent/child identity relationships (depth tracking, owner_id)
- [x] `inherit_permissions` — dynamic resolution (live pointer, not copy)
- [x] Sub-identity CRUD for agents (via `POST /v1/identities` with `kind: sub_agent` and `parent_id`)
- [x] Sub-agent idle cleanup with two-phase archive (backend) — idle archive, retention purge, restore endpoint, per-org config
- [ ] Agents view: archived sub-agent list with restore button, org sub-agent cleanup config form (`subagent_idle_timeout_secs`, `subagent_archive_retention_days`), `archived_at`/`last_active_at` columns in identity tree
- [x] Permission chain walk (ancestor chain, gap detection)
- [x] Approval bubbling (current_resolver tracking, explicit bubble_up, auto-bubble timer, rule placement on closest non-inherit ancestor)
- [ ] Approval visibility scoping (`?scope=actionable` vs `?scope=mine`)
- [ ] Webhook: include `gap_identity` and `can_be_handled_by` in approval events
- [x] Org-level ACL — role-based access control via group membership on the `overslash` meta service, plus an `is_org_admin` fast-path on User identities. Naked org-level identities/API keys removed (migration 028).
- [x] Agents view: identity hierarchy tree view (PR #105)
- [ ] Agents view: per-agent permission management UI (rules, scopes, "Allow & Remember" review/edit)

## Phase 4: Polish + Meta Tools

- [ ] Meta tool definitions (overslash_search, overslash_execute, overslash_auth)
- [x] Semantic search for service/action discovery — `GET /v1/search` with keyword + fuzzy + local pgvector embeddings (PR pending)
- [x] Rate limiting per identity — two-tier model (User bucket + identity caps), Redis/Valkey or in-memory
- [ ] Org billing / usage metering
- [x] Human-readable audit descriptions — interpolated descriptions for Mode C, method+URL for Mode A, identity name resolution in audit responses
- [ ] Org settings view: org settings, webhook management, bulk permission operations
- [ ] Global service registry contribution workflow (community PRs)
- [ ] Documentation site

## Ongoing: Testing Coverage

- [ ] Increase integration test coverage across all API routes
- [ ] Add unit tests for core permission resolution logic
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases in OAuth token refresh and BYOC fallback
- [ ] Dashboard component tests
- [ ] E2E tests for MCP OAuth enrollment (full `/oauth/authorize` → `/oauth/consent` → `/oauth/token` flow driven by an MCP client)
